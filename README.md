ü©∫ Sana: Your AI-Powered Health Assistant
Sana is an AI-driven health assistant designed to revolutionize how we approach non-urgent medical needs. By providing 24/7 symptom assessment and intelligent guidance, Sana empowers users to make informed decisions about their health, reducing unnecessary emergency department (ED) visits and lowering healthcare costs.

The Problem
The U.S. healthcare system faces significant strain from millions of non-urgent ED visits each year. These visits, often for minor issues like medication refills or mild infections, are not only costly to patients but also divert critical resources from true medical emergencies.

Costly & Inefficient: Over 61% of ED visits are for non-urgent issues, leading to an unnecessary strain on the system and high costs for patients.

Financial Burden: Patients can spend over $2,000 annually on frequent outpatient visits alone, before factoring in additional tests or treatments.

Our Solution: Sana
Sana addresses these challenges head-on by acting as a first point of contact for health concerns. Our goal is to guide users toward the most appropriate and cost-effective care pathway, whether that's self-management, a telehealth consultation, or an in-person visit.

Reduce Unnecessary ED Visits: Our AI Symptom Checker helps users differentiate between urgent and non-urgent symptoms, preventing avoidable hospital trips.

Lower Healthcare Costs: Sana provides cost-saving guidance by suggesting lower-cost care options and helping users manage their conditions proactively.

Streamline Care: We offer tools to help manage chronic conditions and preventive care, reducing the need for frequent, routine consultations.
